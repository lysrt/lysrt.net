      <description>When self hosting my website, most of the time I had to choose between Apache HTTP Server and NGINX.
For a simple web site, Apache would be more than enough all the time.
Comes the need to host an API? No worries, Apache can proxy several endpoints on a single computer. Have several Domain Names and this is it. But what if you need to do something like: mysite.com/api/? NGINX reverse proxy was the way to go for me.</description>
